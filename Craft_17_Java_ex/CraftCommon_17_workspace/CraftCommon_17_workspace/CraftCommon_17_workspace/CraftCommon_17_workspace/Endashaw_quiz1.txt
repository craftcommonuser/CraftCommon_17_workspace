However, unlike the relational database, non-relational database has no table, rows, primary or foreign keys. Instead, the non-relational database uses a storage model optimized for specific requirements of the type of data being stored. It is document based.

7. List examples of Relation Database Management System(RDBMS)?

   DDL changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering a table, etc
   All the command of DDL are auto committed that means it permanently save all the changes in the database
   DML commands are used to modify the database. It is responsible for all forms of changes in the database. The command of DML is not auto committed that means it can't permanently save all the changes in the database. They can be rollback
   DCL commands are used to grant and take back authority from any database user. Grant and revoke are some commands that come under DCL.
   TCL commands can only be used with DML commands like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE only. These operations are automatically committed in the database, that's why they cannot be used while creating tables or dropping them.
